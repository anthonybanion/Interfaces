# Interactive Web Interfaces

Interactive Web Interfaces is a growing collection of modular web applications built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each application is independently developed and accessible through a unified card-based gallery. This project serves as a showcase of frontend development skills, focusing on interactivity, modularity, and user experience without relying on external frameworks.

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this repository is to continuously develop and expand a suite of interactive web interfaces. Each interface is designed to function independently, demonstrating specific functionalities and design patterns. The collective gallery provides an organized and accessible way to explore each application.

## 🧩 Features

1. Password Generator

- Includes special symbols (!@#$%^&\*()) for stronger password creation.
- "Clear" button to reset the password field.
- Validation system to assess password strength, notifying users if the password is weak (e.g., lacks numbers or uppercase letters).

2. Expense Control
- Alerts when a recorded expense exceeds $150.
- Additional field for detailed expense descriptions.
- Edit functionality for registered expenses.

3. Basic Calculator

- Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```text

Interfaces/
├── calculator/
├── expense_control/
├── password_generator/
├── student_management/
├── main/
│   ├── static/
│   └── index.html
└── README.md

```

> - Each folder (calculator, expense_control, etc.) contains the source code for an individual application.
> - The main/ directory houses the index.html file, which serves as the entry point, displaying all applications in a card-based gallery.
> - The static/ folder contains shared assets like CSS and JavaScript files used across multiple applications.
